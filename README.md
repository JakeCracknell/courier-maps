Big maps require lots of memory!

Download the .osm map and if one exists, the .aa file.
Unzip them!
Put both in the maps directory
Launch AutomatedAgents.exe and pick map from file menu
Download your own map from openstreetmap.org:
	Go to Export > Manually select area > Overpass API,
	Rename file to have file extension .osm: e.g. iceland.osm
